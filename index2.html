        <h2>Things to Know Before You Go to Egypt</h2>
        <p>Egypt is a very beautiful country, but there are a few things you need to keep in mind to make sure you have a good trip.
          Egypt is a very hot country for the majority of the year, but it is still important to dress modestly because in Arabic
          culture, women should cover their shoulders and not wear tight skirts. This is just to be rerspectful. Furthermore, it is important
          that you see the weather before you go, that way you do not go when it is super hot. Try to avoid going in the summer.
          When it comes to food and water, be cautious because many tourists can experience stomach issues when going to Egypt. Therefore,
          please drink mostly from water bottles. Remember, this also goes for any ice as well! Finally, bargaining is a very common practice
          at the markets and market places in Egypt, so you can totally try to negotiate a deal. In fact, it is part of the shopping experience! 
          From respecting local customs to choosing the right time to visit, these tips will help you have the best time. Please see below for a bullet list of 
          the very most important tips and tricks. </p>
